## 🧪 Model Training

The `model_train.py` script:

- Loads and cleans dataset  
- Splits data into training and testing sets  
- Trains Multinomial Naive Bayes model  
- Evaluates model accuracy  
- Saves:
  - `disease_model.pkl`
  - `symptom_list.pkl`

Run training locally:

```bash
python model_train.py
```
